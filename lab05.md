**Lab 5: Binary Search Tree**

Implement operations for a Binary Search Tree class starting from the template provided in the GitHub repository, using the class TreeNode that is also provided. You may (should) implement helper methods that make your code easier to write, read, and understand. You will also need to write test cases of your own as you develop the methods. You may use iterative and/or recursive functions in your implementation.

The following starter files are available on GitHub.

- **binary\_search\_tree.py**
- **binary\_search\_tree\_tests.py**

Complete the implementations and ensure that the following are pushed to GitHub.

- **binary\_search\_tree.py**
- **binary\_search\_tree\_test.py**
- **queue\_array.py (from lab 3)**
- **queue\_array\_tests.py (from lab 3)**
